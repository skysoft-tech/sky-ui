Calendar isâ€¯a UI component used for displaying dates and days in an app.
Supporting different features, it enables users to easily manage calendar
functionalities, create special date in a calendar, navigate to a preferred
date in it, and show events in an Angular calendar month view, week view, or
day view in a single click.

## Simple example

This example shows the simplest use of the calendar - selecting a single date.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("CalendarDemoComponent") }}

## Range usage

This example demonstrates using a calendar to select two dates - that is, a
range of dates.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("CalendarRangeDemoComponent") }}

## Month view only

In some cases it is necessary to allow the user to select only the month and
year, without selecting the day of the month. The following example
demonstrates this mode.

{{ NgDocActions.demo("CalendarMonthViewDemoComponent") }}

## Special dates

The calendar supports highlighting special days to inform the user. The example
below shows days 5-10 and 20 as special days for the current month.
